# Motivation

At [Legacy](https://wearelegacy.dk), we maintain a [public Tech
Radar](https://wearelegacy.github.io/legacy-tech-radar/) to help our engineering teams
align on technology choices. It is based on the [pioneering work
by ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).


## Deployment

Tech Radar is a static page, so it can be deployed using any hosting provider of your choice offering static page hosting. 

The tech radar is deployed as a github page accessable here https://wearelegacy.github.io/legacy-tech-radar/

## Local Development

1. install dependencies with yarn (or npm):

```
yarn 
```

2. start local dev server:

```
yarn start
```

3. your default browser should automatically open and show the url
 
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
